# Basic Types

## Functions

- Block of reusable code that performs a specific tasks
- Can take arguments, process those inputs and returns a result
- Functions must annotate arguments type and return type

## Diverging functions:

- Never return to the caller
- So they may be used in places where a value of any type is expected
- E.g: panic, looping forever, quitting program

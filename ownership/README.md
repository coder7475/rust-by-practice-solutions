# Ownership

- Rust's ownership is unique

- Set of rules that govern memory management

- Rules are enforced at compile time

- If any of the rules are violated, the program won't compile

## Terminologies

- **Owner**: The owner of a value is the variable or data structure that
  holds it and is responsible for all allocating and freeing the memory
  used to store that data

- **Scope**: A range within a program for which an item is valid

## Rules of ownership

1. Each value in Rust has an owner

2. There can be only one woner at a time

3. When owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

## Types of Scope

1. **Global Scope**

   - Accessible throughout the entire program

2. **Local Scope**

   - Accessible only within particular function or block of code
   - Not accessible outside of that function or block

## Issues ownership helps solving

- Dangling Pointer

- Double free

  - Trying to free memory that has already been freed

- Memory leaks
  - Not freeing memory that should have been freed

## Borrowing & Referencing

- Borrowing is a way to temporarily access data **without taking ownership** of it

- When borrowing, you're taking **reference** (_pointer_) to the data, not the data itself

- It prevents dangling pointers and data races

- Data can be borrowed two ways:
  - **Immutabily**
  - **Mutably**
